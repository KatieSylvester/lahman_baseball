This is a complex and large dataset. I intially explored the database to determine the range of years it covers, the number of teams, number of players, etc.  I discovered that the shortest player in the MLB was Eddie Gaedel who was only 3'7"!  He only played one game for the St. Louis Browns and his uniform number was "1/8".  

I looked at the success of MLB players that came from Tennessee universities, the correlation between number of wins and team salary, correlation between attendance at home games and number of wins as well as other groups of metrics such as average number of strikeouts per game by decade and success of players stealing bases.
